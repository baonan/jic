v13.37.2 (2013-09-15)
---------------------

Bugfixing and new features:

[+] New configuration file format - Python
    Enables addition of more configurable options with complex structure
    (e.g. lists, dictionaries, etc), which are needed for the future
    features.

[#] Documentation fixes
    Corrected help text (typos, wording).

[#] Bug: sometimes JIRA is complaining about '%' symbol in queries.
    [i] Root cause: JIRA requires certain symbols (e.g. '.', '@') to be
        quoted in JQL queries and shell is removing quotes unless those
        are escaped (which is inconvenient).
    [i] No need to escape quotes in command line anymore - now quotes
        are added automatically if not specified by the user.

[+] More issue types are supported
    [i] Bug 'BUG' and New feature 'FEA' are added.

[#] Some code cleanup.
